frog has nn integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an, and she wants to add them pairwise.

Unfortunately, frog is somehow afraid of carries (进位). She defines *hardness* h(x,y)h(x,y)for adding xx and yy the number of carries involved in the calculation. For example, h(1,9)=1,h(1,99)=2h(1,9)=1,h(1,99)=2.

Find the total hardness adding nn integers pairwise. In another word, find

$∑ 1 ≤ i &lt; j ≤ n h ( a i , a j ) ∑_{1≤i&lt;j≤n}h(ai,aj)$
